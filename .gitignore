# Ignore node_modules directory
# This directory contains installed dependencies

# Ignore all .log files
# Log files are generated during runtime or debugging

# Build output
#When working on projects, especially in web development, build outputs 
#(e.g., files in dist/ and build/) are generated from compiling source code. 
#Adding these directories to .gitignore prevents versioning unnecessary files, 
#reduces repository size, avoids merge conflicts, and keeps the focus on the actual codebase.
