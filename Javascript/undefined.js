//A datatype in js used to represent a variable that hasn't been assigned any value yet.
let first_name;
console.log(first_name); //undfined
//also assign  undefined to a variable explicily as follow:
let last_name = undefined;
//but this is usually not recommended ,bcs js has another value called null which is used to make a variiable as empty.
